Hi, my name is **Byoute**. I am a *software developer*, working as **TD** in the *VFX department* of my studio. I'll be sharing some *piece of code* or any information related to the **CG industry**. 

Besides coding, I like chocolate :cookie:, movies :clapper:, theater :dancer:, reading :book: and cooking :fork_and_knife:. And I love my grumpy life partner :couplekiss:, my fluffy kitten :heart_eyes_cat: and travelling around the World :airplane:. Also, I am a [Siggraph](http://www.siggraph.org/) addict.

So feel free to comment my articles (*with good reasons, not for the love of spamming please!*) and I hope you'll my tiny place on the internet.

Cheers! 
Byoute :princess:
