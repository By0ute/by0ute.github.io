Hi, my name is **Byoute**. I am a *software developer*, working as **TD** in the *VFX department* of my studio. I'll be sharing some *piece of code* or any information related to the **CG industry**. 

Besides coding, I like chocolate, movies, theater, reading and cooking. And I love my grumpy life partner <3, my fluffy kitten and travelling around the World. Also, I am a [Siggraph](http://www.siggraph.org/) addict.

So feel free to comment my articles (*with good reasons, not for the love of spamming please!*) and I hope you'll like my tiny place on the internet.

Cheers! 

**Byoute**
